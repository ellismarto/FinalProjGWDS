                <p>Below is my reflecion of this module and website design</p>
            </br>
            </br>
                <p class="refl-text">During this module we have learnt a variety of new skills in order to be able to complete this final website. We started off with completing our HTML worksheets, which taught us the basics of HTML and CSS. This then gave us the building blocks to be able to create a simple working website. A few weeks into the semester we started to use InDesign and Illustrator to create typographic system posters and balloon fiesta posters, which we then used to add some content to our website. I really enjoyed this part of the module specifically because it allowed me to show off my creative side and how I can utilise more than one piece of software to make great designs.</p>
        </br>
                <p class="refl-text">At the start of the semester I got started on the HTML worksheets straight away. This was so that by the time I got around to starting the actual website I would already have the basics learnt and could then work on perfecting them. After this I worked on my typographic system posters. I completed these fairly quickly due to already being good at graphic design. I then implemented these systems into my balloon posters in order to make them look better at practice the skills I have now learnt.</p>
        </br>
                <p class="refl-text">For my website I first planned out the rough placement/layout of the pages and buttons. After this I coded in a outline for my home page and then got to work on making the header navigation bar complete. One thing I was set on adding is that I wanted the nav bar to show what current page of the website the user is on. I achieved this by making the title of that current page bold. I think this is a nice addition due to the fact not many websites have this and I feel that it provides a better user experience. On top of this in the nav bar I made sure to seperate 'Home' and 'Reflection' from the other titles to emphasise to the user that they come under seperate categories. Next I found a background on Unsplashed and then quickly realised that my typography posters where hard o see on the black background. I tackled this issue by leaving the header with the patterned background and then giving the actual content section a solid colour background. Another addition I wanted to include was that when the user hovers over a poster or image it expands, allowing for people with poor eyesight to be able to see the poster and description easier.</p>
        </br>
                <p class="refl-text">Overall I really enjoyed this semesters assignment. I feel that it let me learn important new skills but at the same time letting me display my own skills, for example my graphics skills. I also look forward to the rest of the years assignments to see what other important skills I can learn.</p>
