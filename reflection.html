                <p>Below is my reflecion of this module and website design</p>

                <p class="refl-text">During this module we have learnt a variety of new skills in order to be able to complete this final website. We started off with completing our HTML worksheets, which taught us the basics of HTML and CSS. This then gave us the building blocks to be able to create a simple working website. A few weeks into the semester we started to use InDesign and Illustrator to create typographic sytem posters and balloon fiesta posters, which we then used to add some content to our website. I really enjoyed this part of the module specifically because it allowed me to show off my creative side and how I can utilise more than one piece of software to make great designs.</p>
        </br>
                <p class="refl-text">At the start of the semester I got started on the HTML worksheets straight away. This was so that by the time I got around to starting the actual website I would already have the basics learnt and could then work on perfecting them. After this I worked on my typographic system posters. I completed these fairly quickly due to already being good at graphic design. I then implemented these systems into my balloon posters in order to make them look better at practice the skills I have now learnt</p>
